### Hello!

I'm a senior dev from Grenoble, France.  
I have a few side projects here, but my day job is almost exclusively on proprietary code.  

If you're the reading type, you can find [📝 blog posts here](https://camillehdl.dev). 

If you'd like a distraction, check out [📷 my photography](https://www.flickr.com/people/camille_hodoul/), it would mean a lot 🙂

You can reach me on twitter, @camilleh.bsky.social or at camilleh@hey.com

Thank you for stopping by, have a nice day 👋
